The user is asked to enter a total amount of calories which he or she would like to consume per day.
After total calories have been set the user is able to add foods to his daily intake.
Subsequently the amount of calories which can consumed by the user shrink. This number is displayed in the
remaining calories section which is updated with every entry the user makes.
